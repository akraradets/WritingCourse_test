% THIS IS THE PREAMBLE: 
% acts as the document's "setup" section. 
% Within the preamble you define the document class (type) together with specifics such as languages to be used when writing the document; 
% loading packages you would like to use (more on this later), and it is where youâ€™d apply other types of configuration.

% \documentclass{article}
\documentclass[10pt, a5paper]{article}
% \documentclass[font_size, paper_size]{classname}
% This is like Article(font_size, paper_size) -> ArticleClass

\usepackage{color}
% \usepacke is like `import` in `python`
% importing `color` will let you use some fun functions.
\definecolor{red}{rgb}{1,0,0}
