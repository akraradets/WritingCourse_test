    \item \textcite{bcilab} asks master and Ph.D. students to publish 1 paper and 3 papers repectivly.
    \item \textcite{2author} -- this is how the 2 authors look like
    \item \textcite{3author} -- this is how the 3 authors look like
    \item \textcite{vaswani2017attention} -- many many authors
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Indirect form}

You probably see this more often. It used for citing sentence (where do you know this).

\begin{itemize}
    \item For the master students, 1 paper. For  Ph.D. students, 3 papers. OK? \cite{bcilab}
\end{itemize}
